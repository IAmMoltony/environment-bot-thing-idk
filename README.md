telegram bot im making for a kodland course idk

## how to start it up

first install telebot

```bash
$ pip install telebot
it will output some stuff just ignore it unless it's an error
```

use pip3 if needed

and now you put in your api token

make a file called `token.txt`

```bash
$ touch token.txt
```

ok and now open it in a text editor like `vim` or vscode (the worst editor ever)

and put ur token nothing else

if theres something else it wont work

like at all

and then just run it

```bash
$ ./main.py
```
